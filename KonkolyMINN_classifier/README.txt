MACHINE LEARNING
In this paper we created a Multiple-Input Neural Network for variable star classification. The base of this neural network is a Convolutional method which classifies phase-folded light curves as images, but can increase the the precision with additional numerical inputs, e.g. period or reddening-free brightness. For details please see Szklen치r et al. (2022).
